# Diff Finder for Visual Studio 2026

DiffFinder (from **[rajeevboobna / shelvesetcomparer](https://github.com/rajeevboobna/shelvesetcomparer)**) extends the existing **[hamidshahid / shelvesetcomparer](https://github.com/hamidshahid/shelvesetcomparer)** Visual Studio extension.
ShelvesetComparer is a Visual Studio extension that allow users to compare contents of two shelvesets (from on or different users).

**DiffFinder** extends it to also

* allow comparison of a shelveset with current workspace local pending changes
* compare shelvesets targeting different branches, e.g. `$/BranchA/path/to/file1` with `$/BranchB/path/to/file1`

Color coding used in file comparison:

* **black**: no difference / both files are identical
* **red**: differences / both files differ
* **blue**: file exists only in one of the compared containers (Shelveset or Pending Changes)

## VisualStudio Marketplace

* [DiffFinder for VS2026 (icnocop)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RamiAbughazalehDiffFinderVS2026)
  * Fork of [dprZoft / shelvesetcomparer](https://github.com/dprZoft/shelvesetcomparer) with additional improvements, including a fix for diff tool arguments containing spaces ([dprZoft#17](https://github.com/dprZoft/shelvesetcomparer/issues/17)) and an automated GitHub Actions build.
* [DiffFinder for VS2026](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dprZoft.DiffFinder-VS2026)
  * New release required because, although [Microsoft VS2026 tries to be backward compatible](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/modernizing-visual-studio-extension-compatibility-effortless-migration-for-extension-developers-and-users/), extensions which depend on VS objects (like TeamExplorer) still need to be recompiled with matching references..

3. File comparison view comparing two Shelvesets:

   * Shelvesets with same file paths (same branch):
![TeamExplorer Diff Finder Button](DiffFinder/Resources/Example_CompareSameBranch.png)

   * Shelvesets with different paths (algorithm tries to find the best match (most common path parts)):
      * differerent branches but same relative path:

      * different branches and different paths:
